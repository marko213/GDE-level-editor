<b>Playing:</b>

Clicking or holding down any normal mouse button (LMB, RMB or MMB (scroll wheel)) makes the player jump.

Pressing the 'R' key restarts the current run.

Pressing the SPACE key will pause (set to edit mode) / unpause the game.

<b>Note: there is no "undo" function as of yet. Be careful with what you do to the level.</b>

You can move in the level with the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).

Holding down the SHIFT key will disable automatic obstacle snapping.
The SHIFT key will also make the movement slower when moving in the level.

Clicking the left mouse button will place the current obstacle onto the level.

Clicking the right mouse button will remove all obstacles behind the cursor.
This is also done when placing an obstacle.

Clicking the middle mouse button (scroll wheel) sets the placeable obstacle to the first obstacle behind the cursor.

Pressing the 'L' key will load the saved level (from data/level.gdat).
This also restarts the current run and is done each time the application is launched.

Pressing the 'S' key will save the level (to data/level.gdat).
Note: no data will be saved (when modifying the level, exiting etc.) unless the 'S' key is pressed.

Pressing the 'C' key will clear the level from any obstacles.

Pressing the 'T' key will toggle the current obstacle between triangles (spikes) and boxes.

Pressing the 'F' key will flip the current obstacle (only effective for triangles).

Pressing the 'N' and 'M' keys will move all obstacles in the current level to the left or right respectively.

Pressing the 'X' key will "fix" the current level (needed to run older levels correctly).
