# GDE level editor

<b>Note: this program should only read / write the files in its directory. But as this is an early version, if you want to be safe(r), don't place important files in the same directory as the program</b>

<br></br>

The GDE level editor is intended for level creation to GDE. To get the modified level to appear in GDE, follow these steps:

1 Create and save your level (see INSTRUCTIONS.md).

2 Locate the main folder for the application (should be the folder in which the application is in) and find the data file in data/level.gdat.

3 Replace the file "level.gdat" in GDE's data folder (where the application is, in the "data" folder). Any other files in the data folders should be ignored by either application.

<br></br>

Both GDE and the GDE level editor come with two similar levels: level.gdat and level_old.gdat. You can use them as a template or start from scratch (see INSTRUCTIONS.md).
